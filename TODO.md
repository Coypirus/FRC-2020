# TODO List

## Tasks

* Understand how to use Phoenix Tuner to quickly tune PID values for things
* Test Calum's DriveSubsystem "improvements"
* Make commands for buttons:
  * Intake out/in, motors on/off
  * Be ready to test EVERYTHING
    * Make a testing step-by-step list
    * Read thru code to check for old logic errors
  * Consult with drivers about buttons
  * Create a handy what-does-what guide for drivers
  * Deploy Intake: Fire pneumatics and enable the motors
* Be ready to use EITHER a split stick or a single stick joystick setup
* Finish ultrasonic wall following code (Peter)
* Write code for vision tracking aiming (Jack)
  * Point turret to the target
  * Rename NetworkTables in RobotInit to something not-testy
* Move to Turret target (Billy)
  * Spin robot to align with camera
* Center turret on robot (Billy)
  * Opposite of the above
* Figure out turret encoder stuff
  * Calum wrote a method that ought to help work around this: it needs testing
* Derek says that if the control panel manipulator is deployed, shooting is risky.  Lets avoid that.
* Update TODO list with stuff from the MINUTES file

## Stuff that needs a robot (or parts thereof) to be tested

* Calum's DriveSubsystem work (in CalumBranch)
* Calum's TurretEncoder adjuster

## Long term goals

* DOCUMENT THE CODE MORE, FOR THE LOVE OF GOD!
* Look at shrinking classes to be a more reasonable size
