# Variables


# Units and Directions 
Use Metric Base Units when possible: 

## Yaw, Roll, Pitch
Yaw is "turning direction": eg, north/south/east/west
Roll is, well, roll: its motion arround the axis aligned with the direction of motion
Pitch is motion "up" or "down", from the prespective of someone facing forward
